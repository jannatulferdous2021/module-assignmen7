In web development, client-side refers to the code that runs on the user's browser, handling tasks like displaying content and handling user interactions. Server-side refers to the code that runs on the web server, handling tasks like processing requests, retrieving data, and generating dynamic content. The main difference is that client-side code is executed on the user's device, while server-side code is executed on the web server.

An HTTP request is a communication made by a client (such as a web browser) to a server, requesting a certain action to be performed. There are several types of HTTP requests, including GET (retrieve data), POST (submit data), PUT (update data), DELETE (remove data), and more. Each type of request serves a specific purpose and has different characteristics.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format commonly used in web development. It provides a standardized way to structure and transmit data between a server and a client. JSON is often used for data storage, API communication, and configuration files, as it is easy to read, write, and parse by both humans and machines.

In web development, middleware refers to software components that sit between the client and the server, intercepting and processing incoming requests. They provide a way to add functionality or modify requests and responses. For example, in an Express.js application, middleware can be used to handle authentication, log requests, or perform data validation before passing the request to the actual route handler.

In web development, a controller is a component or module that handles the business logic and acts as an intermediary between the user interface and the model in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. The controller receives input from the user interface (views), processes it, interacts with the model (data), and updates the views accordingly. Its role is to handle user interactions, manage data flow, and coordinate the overall behavior of the application.
